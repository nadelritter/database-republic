## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This project uses a serverless, automated architecture to function without manual intervention.

1.  A **GitHub Action** is scheduled to run a **Python script** every 6 hours.
2.  The Python script downloads and parses the latest official **Trade Republic PDF document**.
3.  It compares the new list against a master CSV stored in the repository, identifying any new or missing stocks.
4.  If changes are found, it updates `added.json` and `removed.json` data files and commits them back to the repository.
5.  A **Cloudflare Worker** acts as a secure API proxy. It uses a secret token to fetch the JSON data from the **private GitHub repository**.
6.  The **Next.js & Tailwind CSS frontend** calls the Cloudflare Worker API to get the data and displays it to the user.
